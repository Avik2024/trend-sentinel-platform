## üèóÔ∏è System Design & Architecture

The architecture is designed for scalability, low latency, and fault tolerance, handling massive volumes of data in real time.

  <p><em>High-Level System Architecture Diagram</em></p>
</div>

### 1. Data Ingestion Layer

- **Source Connectors**: Dedicated services connect to external APIs (e.g., Twitter/X API, Reddit API, NewsAPI). These connectors are responsible for fetching data and handling API rate limits and authentication.
- **Message Broker (Apache Kafka)**: All incoming data is published to Kafka topics (e.g., `twitter_posts`, `reddit_comments`). Kafka acts as a highly scalable, persistent buffer, decoupling the data producers from the consumers and ensuring data durability.

### 2. Real-Time Processing Layer

- **Stream Processor (Apache Flink)**: A Flink cluster consumes data from Kafka topics. Flink is chosen for its true streaming capabilities, low latency, and robust state management.
- **Processing Jobs**:
    - **Enrichment**: Raw data is parsed, cleaned, and enriched with metadata.
    - **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Keywords, entities, and hashtags are extracted.
    - **Sentiment Analysis**: A machine learning model (e.g., a pre-trained transformer model) is applied to assign a sentiment score to each piece of content.
    - **Aggregation**: Data is aggregated into time windows (e.g., 1-minute intervals) to calculate metrics like mention counts and average sentiment.
    - **Anomaly/Spike Detection**: Flink's Complex Event Processing (CEP) library or custom logic is used to detect sudden spikes in metrics, which triggers alerts.

### 3. Data Storage Layer

- **Search & Analytics (Elasticsearch)**: Processed and enriched posts are indexed in Elasticsearch. This allows for powerful, fast, full-text search and complex ad-hoc queries from the frontend.
- **Time-Series Database (InfluxDB)**: Aggregated metrics (mention counts per topic, average sentiment) are stored in a time-series database. This is highly optimized for storing and querying time-stamped data, which is ideal for powering the dashboard charts.
- **Raw Data Lake (S3)**: For compliance and historical analysis, raw, unprocessed data can be archived in a cost-effective object store like Amazon S3.

### 4. Backend & API Layer

- **API Service (Node.js/GraphQL)**: A backend service provides a GraphQL API for the frontend. This API queries Elasticsearch for post data and InfluxDB for chart metrics. GraphQL allows the frontend to request exactly the data it needs, reducing payload size.
- **Real-Time Push (WebSockets)**: A WebSocket server is used to push new posts, updated metrics, and alerts to connected clients in real-time, providing a live dashboard experience without constant polling.

### 5. Frontend (Presentation Layer)

- **Web Application (React)**: The user interface is a single-page application built with React and TypeScript. It provides an interactive and responsive dashboard for data visualization.
- **State Management**: Client-side state is managed to handle the influx of real-time data from WebSockets efficiently.
- **Visualization (Recharts)**: Interactive charts and graphs are used to visualize trends, sentiment, and other key metrics.
